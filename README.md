*The Dictionary About (Almost) Everything.*

### About
The idea is to provide definitions for common words and terms in software engineering, cryptography, mathematics and physics - in Layman's terms.  

Especially for beginners, the new terms can be overwhelming. This document seeks to solve this by providing real world examples whenever possible. Note that the first two chapters, *Computer Science* and *Encryption*, is covered most heavily.

### Contribute
This is a document that is meant to be understood by everyone. Ambitious, *indeed*. To achieve this, there needs to be more definitions added. For that reason, any contribution is appreciated. Styling, corrections, new definitions, anything.
