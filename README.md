**The Dictionary About (Almost) Everything.**

### About
The idea is to provide definitions for common words and terms in software engineering, cryptography, mathematics and physics - in Layman's terms.  

Especially for beginners, new terms can be overwhelming. This document seeks to solve this by providing real world examples whenever possible. Note that the first two chapters, *Computer Science* and *Encryption*, is covered most heavily (at least at this point).

### Contribute
The hope is that anyone who wants to learn more about any of the topics in this book, should be able to read a book/article about that topic purely using this dictionary. Therefore, the book should cover *at least* most of the basic and intermediate terms for that topic. To achieve this, any type of contribution, styling, corrections, new definitions, translations is highly encouraged.
