\textbf{Min-max\index{min-max}} \\
In game theory, min-max is a recursive function that seeks to maximize the minimum \textit{gain}. The gain is often points. 

\textbf{Perfect information game\index{perfect information game}} \\
A game where all the information needed is known to the player. Chess is an example of a perfect information game, while poker is not. 

\textbf{Zero sum game\index{zero sum game}} \\
Zero-sum is a situation in which one person's gain is equivalent to another's loss, so the net change in wealth or benefit is zero. A zero-sum game may have as few as two players, or millions of participants. \\
\textit{E.g: In tac-tac-toe, a win generates 1 point, a loss generates -1 point and 0 if it's a draw.}
