\textbf{Agent\index{agent}} \\
An agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon the environment through actuators. The job of AI is to design an agent program that implements the agent function â€“ the mapping from percepts to actions. \\

\centerline{$agent = architecture + program$}

The architecture is a computing device of some sort with physical sensors and actuators. 

\textbf{Artificial General Intelligence\index{artificial general intelligence}} \\
\acrfull{agi} is a machine that is able to solve \textit{any} intellectual task that a human being can. \acrshort{agi} is the ultimate goal in the field of \acrshort{ai} research.
