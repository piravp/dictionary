\textbf{Botnet} \index{botnet}  \cite{cybersecurity:botnets} \\
A botnet is different from a isolated machine with malware. A botnet is a collection of infected machines which are coordinated through a central server called the Command \& Contrtrol server, C\&C server. The users of the machines involved in a botnet isn't necessarily aware that they're a part of the botnet.  A classic example for which a botnet can be used is a DDoS attack (hence the D in Distributed).
