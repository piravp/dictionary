    \textbf{DHCP\index{DHCP}} \\
    \acrfull{dhcp} is a network protocol responsible for assigning IP addresses to hosts on a network. The host sends out a broadcast and gets an answer from all the DHCP-servers nearby. It's then up to the host to choose one server and then inform all the other servers which one it chose. Considering the host is IP-less the packet is broadcasted with \textit{UDP}. A DHCP server is often found integrated inside a \textit{router}. 

    
    \textbf{DNS}    \\
    \acrfull{dns} translates an \textit{IP-address} to a website. \\
    Example: For instance, YouTube's IP address is 216.58.209.142. Without DNS you would have to type in the IP-address, instead of youtube.com.  

    
    
    \textbf{SSH\index{SSH}} \\
    \acrfull{ssh} is a cryptographic network protocol used over unsecured networks. It's commonly used to perform remote login on a machine.
