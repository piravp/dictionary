\textbf{Porting\index{porting}} \\
In software engineering, porting is the process of taking one software/library that's written for a specific environment
(read: programming language) and make it runnable in another environment. \\
For instance taking a library that's written for Java and making it runnable in C\#. This can be done either manually - which requires the developer to know both the source platform (Java) and the target platform (C\#) - or it can be done by automating the process using tools like Sharpen. \\
Another example may be a web application that is ported to a mobile application.
