\section{Key exchange}

\textbf{Diffie-Hellman key exchange} \\
Diffie-Hellman is an algorithm used to establish a shared secret between two parties. It is primarily used as a method of exchanging cryptography keys for use in symmetric encryption algorithms like AES \cite{keyexchange:diff-hellman}.

\begin{example}
A Diffie-Hellman exhange:
\end{example}



\begin{enumerate}
% 1
\item Alice and Bob agree on a prime number, \textcolor{red}{$p$}, and a base, \textcolor{blue}{$g$}, in advance. For our example, let's assume that \textcolor{red}{$p=23$} and \textcolor{blue}{$g=5$}.

% 2
\item Alice chooses a secret integer \textcolor{ForestGreen}{$a$} whose value is $6$ and computes \textcolor{orange}{A} = \textcolor{blue}{$g$}\textcolor{ForestGreen}{$^a$} $mod$ \textcolor{red}{$p$}. In this example, \textcolor{orange}{$A$} has the value of $8$.

% 3
\item Bob chooses a secret integer \textcolor{ForestGreen}{$b$} whose value is 15 and computes \textcolor{orange}{B} = \textcolor{blue}{$g$} \textcolor{ForestGreen}{$^b$} $mod$ \textcolor{red}{$p$}. In this example, \textcolor{orange}{B} has the value of 19.

% 4
\item Alice sends \textcolor{orange}{$A$} to Bob and Bob sends \textcolor{orange}{$B$} to Alice.

% 5
\item To obtain the shared secret, Alice computes \textcolor{NavyBlue}{$s =$} \textcolor{orange}{$B$} \textcolor{ForestGreen}{$^a$} $mod$ \textcolor{red}{$p$}. In this example, Alice obtains the value of \textcolor{NavyBlue}{$s=2$}.

% 6
\item To obtain the shared secret, Bob computes \textcolor{NavyBlue}{$s =$} \textcolor{orange}{$A$} \textcolor{ForestGreen}{$^b$} $mod$ \textcolor{red}{$p$}. In this example, Bob obtains the value of \textcolor{NavyBlue}{$s=2$}.
\end{enumerate}
